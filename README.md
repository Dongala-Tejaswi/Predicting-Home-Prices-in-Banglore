# Predicting Home Prices in Bangalore

This project uses machine learning to predict home prices in Bangalore based on various features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate the price of a house in Bangalore. This is useful for buyers, sellers, and real estate analysts to make informed decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- `bhp.csv` — dataset containing house details and prices.
- `columns.json` — JSON file containing column details for model input.

Dataset includes features such as:
- `location` — Area in Bangalore
- `total_sqft` — Total square feet area
- `bhk` — Number of bedrooms
- `bath` — Number of bathrooms
- `price` — Price of the property

## Files
- `Notebook.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook containing data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and predictions.
- `bhp.csv` — Dataset used for training and testing.
- `columns.json` — JSON file containing columns for the model.

## Libraries Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
